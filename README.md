# Hi there, I'm Isha Sah ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate learner, programmer and developer with focus on full stack development and have experience with languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm curious about AI and eager to contribute to various development fields. I'm also passionate about learning Java backend stacks such as Spring Boot and microservices.

Currently, I'm exploring full stack technologies, particularly React.js and Express.js. I have experience with SQL for database communication and additional knowledge of C, C++, and Python.
